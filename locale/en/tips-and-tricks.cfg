traindepot-1-h=Usability
traindepot-1-1=[entity=traindepot] is used to store freshly made trains. Of course you can also send other trains that are out of use to these stations. When you are in need of more trains, you can take them from the depot and put them to use. You can even do this from the mapview without needing to be close to the depot!
traindepot-2-h=Depot statistics
traindepot-2-1=When you open the [entity=traindepot] (__CONTROL__open-gui__), you can see some basic information about the depot.
traindepot-2-2=[font=default-semibold]Depot name:[/font] The name of this depot. By pressing the edit button or switching tabs, you can change the depot name to anything you want, similar to how you change the name of a train stop. Of course you can also use the copy/paste tool for renaming purposes.
traindepot-2-3=[font=default-semibold]Available depot spots:[/font] The amount of depot spots that are available. This is shown as "available/total" station count. Building more stations with the same name extends the total amount of trains that stay in the depot.
traindepot-3-h=Depot configuration settings
traindepot-3-1=[font=default-semibold]Requested amount:[/font] In the depot menu, you can set the amount of trains you want to have in the depot. When the amount of trains that is present in the depot is lower than the requested amount, the connected builders will create more trains until the request is fullfilled.
traindepot-3-2=[font=default-semibold]Connected trainbuilders:[/font] The trainbuilders that are connected to this depot to fulfill the requests. This also shows a list of all the controllers which you can access from here.
